This script automates the deployment of a Sparrow cluster on ec2. To use it:

1) Get an ec2 account.

2) Get your access key ID and value from ec2. You need to have these available
   in environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   respectively.

3) Generate a key-pair in the AWS control panel in the "US East" datacenter.

4) Run ./ec2_exp.sh --help to see how the script works.

   The basic workflow would is usually like this.
   # Launch instances
   ./ec2-exp.sh launch -k eastkey -i ~/.ssh/eastkey.pem

   # Deploy Sparrow files, waiting 100 seconds for instances to boot before
   # attempting to contact them. This will generate config files and send
   # them to all machines.
   ./ec2-exp.sh deploy -k eastkey -i ~/.ssh/eastkey.pem -w 100

   # Start Sparrow
   ./ec2-exp.sh start -k eastkey -i ~/.ssh/eastkey.pem

   # Stop Sparrow
   ./ec2-exp.sh stop -k eastkey -i ~/.ssh/eastkey.pem
